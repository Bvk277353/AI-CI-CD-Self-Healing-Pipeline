AI Self-Healing CI/CD Pipeline — Project Memory File

Author: ChatGPT (with Bala Vardhan Kumar)
Purpose: Persistent project context to restore full understanding if chat history is lost
Last Stable State: Pipeline, metrics, Grafana, ML models running successfully via Docker

1️⃣ Project Vision (VERY IMPORTANT)

This project is NOT a static CI/CD app.

It is a generic AI-powered Self-Healing CI/CD backend pipeline that can work with ANY application.

Core Idea

Applications are deployed via GitHub Actions

CI/CD failures happen (intentionally or naturally)

This pipeline:

Detects failures

Predicts failure risk using ML

Analyzes logs

Applies auto-healing actions

Re-runs pipeline

Exposes metrics & health dashboards

Each new app → can have its own trained ML model.

2️⃣ What Is Already COMPLETED ✅
✔ Infrastructure

Docker Compose–based microservice architecture

Services running successfully:

pipeline-monitor (FastAPI)

demo-app (FastAPI test app)

postgres

redis

prometheus

grafana

nginx

✔ ML System

Trained ML models stored in:

ai-healing-cicd-fixed/models/
  ├── failure_predictor.pkl
  ├── healing_predictor.pkl
  ├── scaler.pkl
  ├── metadata.pkl


Failure prediction model works

Healing model uses DummyClassifier when only one class exists

Models load correctly inside Docker

✔ Pipeline Monitor (Backend Brain)

FastAPI service

Endpoints working:

/health

/predict

/metrics

GitHub Actions monitoring loop implemented

Prometheus metrics exposed correctly

Redis + DB connectivity working

✔ Observability

Prometheus scrapes:

pipeline-monitor

demo-app

redis-exporter

Grafana running and dashboards accessible

Metrics visible (UP state achieved)

4️⃣ What the Pipeline ACTUALLY Does
During GitHub Actions execution:

GitHub workflow runs (build/test/deploy)

Workflow fails (e.g.):

flaky tests

dependency version error

package install failure

Pipeline Monitor:

Fetches workflow + logs

Extracts features

Predicts failure risk (ML)

Healing Engine:

Matches known failure patterns

Applies fixes:

retry tests

pin dependency versions

clear cache

reinstall packages

Pipeline re-runs

Results + metrics updated

Grafana shows:

pipeline health

failure rate

healing success

5️⃣ What Is NOT Done Yet (NEXT STEPS 🚀)
🔜 Step 1 — GitHub Actions Integration (CRITICAL)

Create intentional failing workflows

Examples:

wrong Python version

missing dependency

flaky test

Workflow must:

fail first

allow pipeline-monitor to react

🔜 Step 2 — Healing Actions That Modify Code

Auto-commit fixes:

requirements.txt

test retries

workflow YAML fixes

Push changes back to GitHub repo

🔜 Step 3 — Multi-App Support

Each app has:

its own ML model

its own failure patterns

Pipeline Monitor selects model dynamically

🔜 Step 4 — Advanced Grafana Dashboard

Panels:

Failure prediction probability

Healing success rate

Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

CI/CD reliability score

6️⃣ Important Notes for Future ChatGPT

If this file is shared again:

The project is already running

The user does not need basic Docker help

Focus ONLY on:

GitHub Actions workflows

Healing logic improvements

ML feature engineering

Dashboard analytics

This is a Final Year / Research-grade project

7️⃣ One-Line Resume Summary

Built an AI-powered self-healing CI/CD pipeline using FastAPI, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, and Machine Learning to automatically detect, predict, and remediate CI/CD failures across multiple applications.
